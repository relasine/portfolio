        <p className="about-content">When I was 16, I was at an impasse of-sorts. I knew that I either wanted to be a computer programmer or a music teacher. Due in no-small-part to a teenage reluctance to want to spend my post-adolescence sitting in college math classes, I choose music. I did that for a long time. I was good at it. I enjoyed working with the kids, but the job wasn't satisfying to me. It was hard work, but it wasn't intellectually challenging, and the pay was not good.</p>
        <p className="about-content">I was born in 1982 and graduated high school in 2000, meaning that I grew up parallel to the internet. Our family bought our first computer, a Gateway 486, when I was 11. When I was 13, we got AOL and a dial-up connection. I experienced the rise-and-fall of Napster. Broadband came when I was a senior in high school. I didn't own a cell phone until I was finished with my freshman year of college. I saw the birth of Amazon, of Facebook, of smart phones.</p>
        <p className="about-content">I thought about these things for years. I thought about how they completely reshaped every facet of our lives, from the way that we communicate, to the way that we plan our meals, that we track our sleep, that we exercise, we travel, the way that we consume media, and share art, and teach our kids. I would think about these things, and then I would think about my son, and I would think about my wife, and our mortgage. And for the longest time I felt like there was a train, and it was racing us by, and I desperately wanted to be on it, so I enrolled at The Turing School of Software and Design.</p>
        <p className="about-content">And I've never been so excited to be working so hard on anything in my life.</p>
        <p className="about-content">The last several months have been hard. The course work is extremely challenging, the project load intense, and I often find myself at peak physical and mental exhaustion. But despite all of that, the only thing I want to do is to pull up my code and to get back to crushing it.</p>
